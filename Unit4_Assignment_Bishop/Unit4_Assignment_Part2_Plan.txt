  1. Add argument char array and count to the main function parameters to allow for command line arguments
  2. Convert char[] arg to int type and use as max value in for loop.
  3. Write logic to cout all numbers from 1 to the input value with ordinal postfixes.
    a. if a number is between the range 10-19, the postfix should be "th"
    b. if the modulus of the number and 10 is 1, the postfix should be "rst"
    c. if the modulus of the number and 10 is 2, the postfix should be "nd"
    d. if the modulus of the number and 10 is 3, the postfix should be "rd"
    e. else the postfix should be "th"
  4. print each number on its own line with "Hello" appended.
